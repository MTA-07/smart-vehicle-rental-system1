# 🚗 Car Rental System

## 📌 About The Project
Car Rental System is a console-based car rental management application developed using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This project simulates a real-world car rental service where users can add vehicles, rent available cars, and return rented vehicles while maintaining structured data management.

The main goal of this project was to practice OOP design, class structure, and clean code organization.
